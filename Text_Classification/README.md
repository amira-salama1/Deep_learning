**Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow**


- Data Source:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data) competition to predict whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not.

- The training data includes the question that was asked, and whether it was identified as insincere (target = 1). The ground-truth labels contain some amount of noise: they are not guaranteed to be perfect.

- In this Guided Project by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow) learned to preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, 
build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
